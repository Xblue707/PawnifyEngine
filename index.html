    <h1>Pawnify Engine</h1>
    <p id="intro">
        Welcome to our Infocomm Project - a chess GUI that runs the Stockfish engine. Our project aims to solve
        the lack of customisability when users play against chess bots online. We understand that playing against a
        chess bot with limited options can be frustrating and limiting. Therefore, we have created a chess GUI that
        allows users to customise almost every aspect of the Stockfish chess engine, from its strength to its playing style.
