# Interface-for-stockfishjs
Chess graphical user interface for stockfish.js with Sound, PGN Notation, FEN, Score, Bestmove, Eval Bar, Multiple Lines, and full stockfish customization.
This is a project work done by 3 friends + me :D to tackle the problem of limited customisability on big chess websites like chess.com and lichess.org as well as the complicated UIs and legacy designs of chess GUIs such as Arena Chess GUI, BanksiaGUI, Cutechess, Nibbler.

Other than the below JavaScript frameworks, everything else is written with VANILLA HTML, CSS, and JS.

Basics:
* http://chessboardjs.com/
* https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js
* https://github.com/niklasf/stockfish.js

To clone repository, use the following command in command prompt:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xblue707/PawnifyEngine
```
Alternatively just download the zip lmao

To run, just use a live server. Simply running the index.html file will not work.
